Wisdom:

James 1: 5, 6 if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all  men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

John 15: 7 if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

1 John 3: 22, 23 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
