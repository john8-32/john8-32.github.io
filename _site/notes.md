Love - God's Love.
Topic - Nothing can separate us from God's Love
  Johna's story - reveals about love of God;

  Romans 8: 35-39 (read 31 also)
   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For i am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   Hosea 11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And i became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And i bent down and fed them.

   -- Rope of God's love hold us. (find the verse)

   Reasons why it is difficult to accept
    1. We have seen love fails around us. - marriage, relationships, etc.
        -- Bible says Love never fails.
        -- Agapae - devine love - It comes from God, it cant be find from humen - Paul talks about this love.

    2. Our sins. - All of us are not perfect - this causes problem.
        -- But bible says when we were in mother's womb, God loved us.
        -- Even before we start doing something good, God loved us, then how can he stops love us by doing a mistake.
        -- God is Love so he loves me, not because what i have done or what i am.
        -- the perfect God loves me the sinner because He is perfect. He is able to do love.

    3. The sufferings that we endure in this life (Paul is dealing with this.)
        -- sufferings make us thing God does not love us.
        -- All sufferings come results of sins in the world.
        -- If we live a happy, successful life - lot of people do not like it, devil does not like it, that is why even if you are not doing anything wrong, troble follows you.
        -- We should not be surprised, by seeing the troubles follows us.
        -- Jesus told there is tribulation in this world, but cheear i have overcome this world (find verse)
        -- Every bad things come form the devil, but we misunderstood God does not love us. And we go ever further and say God why are you doing this? what have i done?

    -- God has removed our sins like how for east is from west (find verse)

        Paul is using five pair of words to explain Nothing can separate us from God's love.

         a. life, death.
          -- death can not separate, life can not separate, nothing in between can separate.
          -- 1 Thessalonians 4: 13 - 17- Paul says "I would not have you to be ignorant"
          -- Where your heart is there your possions, my heart is with GOD. (find verse)
          -- life and its problem can not separate form the love of God.
         b. angles, principalities. (principalities refers to fallen angels - devil)

         c. things present, things to come.
          -- we are worried about things happening today, some worried about future.
          -- Dont give up - We are more than conquerors Romans 8: 37.
         d. height, depth.
          -- Above heaven bellow hell nothing can separate.
          -- height and downs in life can not separate.
          -- Example Joseph - he was down (pit) - then up - then down - later he become the prime minister.
         e. powers, other creature.
          -- powers refers to Might deeds or Miracles and refers to people in powers. Authority.
          -- anything that created, What ever exists in this world, nothing can separate

  Jeremiah 31: 3 - The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee.

Ephesinans 3: 14 - 19
  -- Four Dimensions of God's Love:
  Ephesinans 3: 18 - May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

  1. Breadth of God's Love
  Revelation 5: 9 - And they sung a new song, saying Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
    -- every kindred, tongue, people and nation refers to how wide is God's love, (breadth) - includes everyone.
  Revelation 7: 9-10 - After this i beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
    -- A great multitude, which no man could number.


  2.Length of God's Love  
  Jeremiah 31: 3 - The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee.
    -- everlasting love - endless love.

  3.Depth of God's Love
  Philippians 2: 5 - 8 - Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought        
  How low He came ? being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross

  Roman 3: 10-18 - Talks about Jesus died for what kind of people ??
  Roman 5: 6, 8, 10. - Without strength - sinners - un Godly - enemies.

  How low God's love can go?

  4.Height of God's Love
  -- Salvation is not just about forgiveness of Sin
  Ephesians 5: 26-27 - That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
