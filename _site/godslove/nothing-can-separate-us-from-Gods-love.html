    <h3 id="introduction-">Introduction:-</h3>
<p>This article is based on the scriptures <em>Romans 8: 35-39</em>. These scriptures clearly says There is nothing, absolutely nothing can separate us from God’s Love. Paul narrate this truth Roman people in an exiting way.</p>

<p><em>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For i am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. *Romans 8: 35-3*</em></p>

<h3 id="gods-love">God’s Love.</h3>
<p>In Bible everywhere we can see God’s Love.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Creation of the World.
    God created everything a human will ever need, just before creating human, then made him to rule everything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very famous verse John 3: 16 says <em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that  whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Nineveh were living a wicked life. God Chose Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh. The people of Nineveh were so cruel, so Jonah wanted the Nineveh to be perished. He resisted and attempted to flee. Eventually Jonah went to Nineveh and prophesied against Nineveh. People of the city repent and God forgive them. Jonah was furious, and he beseeched God to kill him. The request was denied when God caused a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. It was grateful, Jonah’s anger returned next day, when God sent a worm to eat the plant, now Jonah tells God that it would be better if he were dead. Then God points out His Love as <em>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: And should not i spare Nineveh, the great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle. Jonah 4: 10, 11</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="some-time-in-our-practical-life-we-feel-does-god-love-me">Some time in our practical life we feel does God Love me?</h3>
<p>If anything goes wrong in our life or if life is not going as we planned, we might think Does God Love me? Following reasons why people does not accept the truth easily.</p>

<h5 id="we-have-seen-love-fails-around-us">1. We have seen love fails around us.</h5>
<p>We have seen human love fails in many places like marriages, relationships, etc. But Bible says Love never fails <em>(1 Corinthians 13:8)</em>. This scripture talks about divine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape">love</a>. So God’s love is not like human love. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape">Agape</a>.</p>

<h5 id="our-sins">2. Our sins.</h5>
<p>We are not perfect and our sins some time make it difficult to believe “Nothing can separate us from God’s Love”. Psalms 139 : 13 says “For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb”. This means God loves us even before we were made, That proves even before we start doing something good, God loved us, hence doing something wrong can not separate us from God’s Love. God loves us not because of what we have done or what we are or by our good deeds. God loves us because He is Love. The perfect God loves the imperfect because He is perfect.</p>

<p>Bible says “<em>As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions</em>”.</p>

<h5 id="the-sufferings-that-we-endure-in-this-life-actually-when-paul-wrote-the-letter-to-romans-he-was-dealing-with-such-situation">3. The sufferings that we endure in this life. (Actually When Paul wrote the letter to Romans he was dealing with such situation)</h5>
<p>Peradventure sufferings make us thing God does not love us. But all the sufferings come results of sins in the world Practically saying, if we live a happy, successful life a lot of people does not like that, enemy does not like it, this  is why even if we are not doing anything wrong, trouble follows us and we should not be surprised, by seeing the troubles follow us. Every bad thing comes form the enemy, but we misunderstood God does not love us. And we go ever further and say God why are you doing this? what have i done? But Jesus told <em>“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</em> John 16: 33.</p>

<h3 id="five-pair-of-words">Five pair of words.</h3>
<p>Paul is using five pair of words to explain Nothing can separate us from God’s love. When we look at all five pair of words it clearly proves nothing can separate us from God’s Love.</p>

<h5 id="a-life-death">a. life, death.</h5>
<p>Death can not separate us from God’s Love. <em>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethern, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him</em> 1 Thessalonians 4: 13,14. We have already seen the sin and the suffering that we endure in this life can not separate from God’s love. Neither death nor life can separate us from God’s love hence nothing in between.</p>

<h5 id="b-angles-principalities">b. angles, principalities.</h5>
<p>This pair of words says about angels and the fallen angels. Principalities refers to fallen angels.</p>

<h5 id="c-things-present-things-to-come">c. things present, things to come.</h5>
<p>Things present refers everything happen around us today. We don’t need to worry about today. Bible says <em>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want</em> Psalms 23 : 1. Things to come says about feature, Roman 8: 37 says <em>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us</em>. So what ever happens, even if it does not look good, do not give up, We are more than conquerors.</p>

<h5 id="d-height-depth">d. height, depth.</h5>
<p>Height and depth can be interpreted as above heaven and bellow hell. Or it can be interpreted as ups and downs in life.       But the truth is neither of it can separate us from the Love of God. If we look at the life of Joseph, he was down, his brothers put him in pit. Joseph was sold to Potiphar(The captain of Pharaoh’s guard). His life was good there. When he ran away from the sin Joseph was held in prison. Then he raised again as Vizier(Like Prime minister). His life was full of ups and downs but eventually he became the Prime Minister of Egypt, and was given, the daughter of Potiphar to be his wife.
##### e. powers, other creature.
  Powers refers to mighty deeds or Miracles. Powers also refers to authority and the people who are in power and uses their power to do wrong things. Other creatures says about anything that has been created or What ever exists in this world.</p>

<p>These five pair of word clearly proves nothing can separate us from God’s Love.</p>
