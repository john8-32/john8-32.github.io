BLESSING:

        HUSBAND - WIFE:
          Ephesians 5: 22 to 25 - Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

          Ephesians 5: 33 - Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be hidden man of heart, in that which is not corruptible, event the ornament of a meek and quiet spirt, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands; Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. Likewise, ye husbands, delll with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.

          1 Corinthians 7: 10, 11 - And unto the married i command, yet not i, but the Lord, let not the wife depart form her husband: But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.

          Genesis 2: 24 - Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

          Ephesians 5: 31 - For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

          Mark 10: 7 to 9 - For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

    Matthew 7: 11 - if ye then, being evil, know how to give gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

    Luke 11: 13 - if ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
