#### Introduction.
  *Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things. Joel 2: 21.* As Joel 2:21 says LORD will do great things. Since our God is great God we should expect Great things from God not the trivial ones.

#### In the life of Joseph -
  When we look at the life of Joseph, God has a big plan. God wanted to raise him as a prime minister. But Joseph might have not known his destiny. That is the reason when he was in prison, he was expecting help from man.  

#### In David's Life  -
  If we look at David's life, Bible says *And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him. 2 Samuel 5: 10.*

  *2 Samuel 7: 21, 22 - For the world's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. Wherefore thou are great, O LORD GOD: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.*

  *2 Samuel 7: 28 - And now, O LORD GOD, thou art that GOD, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:*

  David was shepherd, he was hopeless on his parent's eye. But God made him King. David understood How great is GOD, and he says thou hast done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. So he praises and thank God. We should also understand that our God is Great, He does the Great things. So we should expect great things in our life.
