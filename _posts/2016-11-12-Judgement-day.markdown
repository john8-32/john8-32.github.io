# Background:-

  I belive in the Kingdom of God and the Judgeent, but i wondered Who is going to Judge us?

### For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. John 5: 26, 27

### When the Son of man shal come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: Matthew 25: 31

### And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. Acts 10: 42

### Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in rightousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. Acts 17: 31

### Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made of perfect love. 1 John 4: 17, 18

  This scripture clearly states The Son of man - JESUS - is the Judge. Jesus went to heven and retained humanity. He is the mediator , a man - between God and human. There is no way to blame our problems, Since Jesus lived rightous, with out sin
