#### Background.
  I had a doubt in my mind. Can i listen to any christian song? Because some songs sound like entertainment song. Because of the [kind of music][0], audio effects  or because of its choice of words. Some songs look like entertainment song because of its visual effects or because of the singer who sing / appear on the screen or because of the dance / performance.

#### The Answer I Found:
  One day i came across *Philippians 1: 15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also good will: The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: But the other of love, knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel. What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.*

  In verse 15 Paul says, *Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife;* and in verse 16 he continues, *The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:* finally in verse 18 he tells, every way Christ is preached; and i there in do rejoice, yea and will rejoice.

  So i believe i got the answer. I dont need to see Who/How/Where/When etc .. As long as they Preach/Sing about LORD Jesus Christ, it is fine.
