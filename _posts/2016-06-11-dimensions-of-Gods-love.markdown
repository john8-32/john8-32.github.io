### Introduction:-
  *Ephesians 3: 18* _May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;_ Ephesians 3: 18 describes the four Dimensions of GOD's Love.

####  1. Breadth of God's Love
  *Revelation 5: 9 - And they sung a new song, saying Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;*

  This revelation says God redeemed every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nations by his blood. This refers how wide *(breadth)* is God's love. Actually it includes everyone.

  *Revelation 7: 9-10 - After this i beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.*

  This revelation says A great multitude, which no man could number.

####  2. Length of God's Love  
  *Jeremiah 31: 3 - The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee.*

  Here the LORD appeared and told Jeremiah "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: " everlasting love can be interpreted as Endless love. So the length of God's Love is Endless and it cant be measured.

####  3. Depth of God's Love
  Philippians 2: 5 - 8 - Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, though        it not robbery to be equal with GOD: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

  How low God can came? This verse says "being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross"

  GOD Came to earth for what kind of people? Roman 3: 10-18 - Talks about Jesus died for what kind of people ??

  *Roman 3: 10-18 As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is note that seeketh after GOD. They all are gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their thoat is an open sepulchre; with their tongue they have used deceit; the poison of asps is unter their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes*

  Roman 5: 6, 8, 10.  These verses says How were we? when God came to rescue us? We were without strength, we were sinners, we were ungodly, we were enemies.

  *For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.*

  These verses says How depth God's love can go to save us.

####  4. Height of God's Love
  Salvation is not just about forgiveness of Sin.

  *Ephesians 5: 26-27 - That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.*
